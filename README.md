# Windmill Interactive Visual
An interactive program that demonstrates the Windmill problem on the 2011 IMO, allowing the user to place points, choose a starting pivot point, and watch as the line sweeps through the points.

[This 3Blue1Brown video](https://youtu.be/M64HUIJFTZM) served as inspiration for this project and brilliantly explains the problem and solution.
